    "Polars supports two modes of operation: lazy and eager. The examples so far have used the eager API, in which the query is executed immediately. In the lazy API, the query is only evaluated once it is collected. Deferring the execution to the last minute can have significant performance advantages and is why the lazy API is preferred in most cases. Let us demonstrate this with an example:"
