    "When using the `LazyFrame` API, it is important to favor `scan_*` (scan_parquet, scan_csv, etc.) over `read_*`. A Polars scan is lazy and will delay execution until the query is collected. The benefit of this, is that the Polars optimizer can push optimization into the readers. They can skip reading columns and rows that aren't required. Another benefit is that, during streaming execution, the engine already can process batches before the file is completely read."
