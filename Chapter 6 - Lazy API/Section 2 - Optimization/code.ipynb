    "| Optimization | Explanation | Runs |\n",
    "|--------------|-------------|------|\n",
    "| Predicate pushdown | Applies filters as early as possible / at scan level. | 1 time |\n",
    "| Projection pushdown | Select only the columns that are needed at the scan level. | 1 time |\n",
    "| Slice pushdown | Only load the required slice from the scan level. Don't materialize sliced outputs (e.g. `join.head(10)`). | 1 time |\n",
    "| Common subplan elimination | Cache subtrees/file scans that are used by multiple subtrees in the query plan. | 1 time |\n",
    "| Simplify expressions | Various optimizations, such as constant folding and replacing expensive operations with faster alternatives. | until fixed point |\n",
    "| Join ordering | Estimates the branches of joins that should be executed first in order to reduce memory pressure. | 1 time |\n",
    "| Type coercion | Coerce types such that operations succeed and run on minimal required memory. | until fixed point |\n",
    "| Cardinality estimation | Estimates cardinality in order to determine optimal group by strategy. | 0/n times; dependent on query |"
